# Quantifying Animal Behaviour
## Download example data, clips and external packages:

[Download: Shared OneDrive Folder](https://neurogears-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/t_ryan_neurogears_org/EokFwZYwH_xNvsJVq05I4wgBOxHhyaGkTTZiAKRU6gzrSA?e=Wq4vSY)

Inside you will find a `Data` folder and an `ExternalPackages` folder containing the cudnn and tensorflow packages. Copy both folders to the root of the repository. You will need them later...

## <u>Install instructions</u>

## Install third party SLEAP dependencies (Optional)
> **NOTE:**  This step is optional for hardware acceleration IF you have a compatible NVidia card. If not, or for slow workflow but easier install, skip this bit.

([Full instructions](https://bonsai-rx.org/sleap/index.html), but we shouldn't need this!)

In order to use the graphics card for hardware accelerated inference in Bonsai, you will need to install the [Cuda Toolkit 11.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.3.0-download-archive) (for SLEAP multi-animal tracking)
   * Select Custom install and check `CUDA > Development` and `CUDA > Runtime` ONLY (uncheck everything else) 

Once installed, could be worth checking your User and System Variables. You should see your Python 3.10 installation on the path of User Variables. You should see the CUDA_PATH is correctly pointing to CUDA 11.3, and the Cuda/bin folder is on the system variables path.

## Bonsai

- In a command terminal, run `setup.cmd` from the `.bonsai` folder
. This will run the powershell script `setup.ps1` to automatically intall a local Bonsai installation you can use to edit and run the Workflows in this project

### Set up python environment for Bonsai.ML
#### 1. <u>(Recommended)</u> Visual Studio Code
[Direct Download: python 3.10 (Windows 64-bit installer)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe) 
[Python release page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

Hit Ctrl-P to bring up the command pallette. Choose `Python: Create Environment...`, then `Venv`.
Choose your **Python 3.10** installation as the interpreter path, and check the `requirements.txt`.

Done. If you now open a new Powershell terminal, the environment will activate automatically.

#### 2. (Optional) From a command line terminal:

Install virtual env if needed
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Create the virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run Bonsai from the command line terminal:

```bash
.\.bonsai\Bonsai.exe
```

### Open the workflows!

## Clone BonFly (uses Bonsai 2.9.1 preview)

```
git clone https://github.com/jfrazao/BonFly.git
```
Install Bonsai by running the `setup.cmd` in the `.\bonsai` folder

## Package Development Working Environment 

### Visual Studio Community (optional)

1. Download and run [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
2. Check .NET Desktop Development workload
3. (optional) uncheck IntelliCode support.

#### Bonsai VS Extensions. 

From the Windows Start Menu, search for the "Install Bonsai VS Extensions" shortcut and run it.

#### Child process debugging

1. Download and install [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool).
2. For each project:
   * Ensure that `launchSettings.json` is set to `"nativeDebugging": true`.
   * Enable child process debugging in the `Debug` > `Other Debug Targets` > `Child Process Debugging Settings`.

### Launch Visual Studio, and set some options up:

Navigate to `TOOLS->Options->Debugging->General` and disable "Require source files to exactly match the original version" .

Go to `TOOLS->Options->Debugging->Symbols` and enable the Microsoft Symbols Server.
Finally, under `TOOLS->Options->Debugging`, check "Enable Just My Code' and "use Manage/UnmanageÂ mode".

### Visual Studio Code

1. Download and run [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Make sure "Add to PATH" option is checked.

### Git for Windows

1. Download and run [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
2. Select components: uncheck all except Git LFS.
3. Default editor: Visual Studio Code.
4. Override default branch name: main
5. Choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd party software".
6. Use bundled OpenSSH.
